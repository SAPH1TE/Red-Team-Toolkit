This is uploaded to github publicly as a mid development snapshot
do not expect things to work nor things to be consistent
this is still yet to be a polished build though for those wondering how to run it
scroll up and go to code in the top right and download it as a zip 
then extract the code into a folder afterwards, go into the same directory that the launcher.sh is within along with the other folders
and then in your terminal in the path type sudo bash launcher.sh
